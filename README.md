# overlapping-circles
Python code that calculates the total area of any number of overlapping (or non-overlapping) circles.  
The list `circles` should be a 2D list of 2x1 numpy arrays (center coordinates) paired with each circle's radius.  
  
You can use the desmos graph https://www.desmos.com/calculator/0lwvrzjsh5 to create circles, and then copy the $r_{adii}$ and $p_{os}$ lists into the `radii_string` and `centers_string` respectively, making sure to remove any spaces.  
  
For example:

With the list of circles generated by:  
`radii_string = r"\left[1,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5\right]"`  
`centers_string = r"\left[\left(0,0\right),\left(0,1\right),\left(0,-1\right),\left(1,0\right),\left(-1,0\right)\right]"`  
  
The algorithm I have used is from:

Behind the scenes, the area above is partitioned into polygons and circle sectors:

So that no area is overlapping.  
  
We then perform some python magic and find the areas of each subsection, and add them together.
